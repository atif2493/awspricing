# Optional override: frontend runs in dev mode with source mounted so local changes take effect.
# Usage: docker compose up (compose merges this automatically).
# Backend already has app mounted + --reload in main compose.
# Uncomment below to run frontend as Vite dev server (live reload) instead of nginx build.

#   frontend:
